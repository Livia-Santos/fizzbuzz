#FizzBuzz

The goal of fizzbuzz is to build a program that can take a number and if the number is evenly divisible by 3, it should return "Fizz", if it's divisible by 5, it should return "Buzz", and if it's divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return "FizzBuzz".

A classic program. Helped me to understand modules.
